    "# Conclusion 🎯\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the **Decision Tree Regressor** outperformed **Linear Regression**, **Lasso Regression**, and **Ridge Regression**, achieving the best results on the insurance dataset. This superior performance can be attributed to several factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-linear Relationships** 🔀  \n",
    "  Decision trees can capture complex, non-linear relationships between features and the target variable, while linear models assume a straight-line relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Interactions** 🤝  \n",
    "  Decision trees automatically model interactions between features, which linear models do not unless you explicitly add interaction terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Outliers and Skewed Data** 📊  \n",
    "  Decision trees are less sensitive to outliers and skewed distributions, which can negatively impact linear models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**However** ⚠️  \n",
    "Decision trees can easily overfit, especially on small datasets or if not properly tuned.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tuning hyperparameters 🛠️**  \n",
    "By tuning the hyperparameters `max_depth` and `min_samples_leaf`, the model achieved better generalization to unseen data, leading to more robust and consistent performance on the test set. ✅"
